# Project Proposal

### Project title:

Group Link

### What and why?

The idea for the "Group Link" project is to connect people with similar ideas and interests into groups to allow people to meet and befriend people with similar interests, and connect to groups of people who may be seeking the same goal as you.
"Group Link" would essentially create a way for us to meet new friends with similar interests and fulfill goals and interests you couldn't pursue by yourself. 

### For whom?

Group Link would be for anyone who (1) wants to find friends with similar interests, (2) wants to follow a hobby or interest and wants to be connected to others following suit.
- Want to play soccer but none of your friends play? Create a group request in the NYC area for people looking to play soccer.
- Want to lose weight and go to the gym? Find a workout buddy through "Group Link" OR find a group of other similarly motivated people to keep in touch with and motivate one another.
- Play a video game but don't know anyone else who likes it? Find someone online through "Group Link"
- ....

### How?

Create a website where user creates a profile including list of interests and hobbies. Website would have the following functionalities:
- Create a group to meet with others of matching hobby
- Suggestions of groups created by others with a matching hobby (ex. soccer, book club...)
- Ability to see and interact with other people's profiles, messaging, ... when you have similar interests.

### Scope

I believe the main, already detailed parts of this project could be feasibly completed with 4-6 given the time constraint. Furthermore I believe the project lends itself well to user stories, and seperating the work among developers.
